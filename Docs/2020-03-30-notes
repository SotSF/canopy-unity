Canopy organization work

- Create subfolders for node types
  - Pattern
  - Filter
  - FloatSignal
  - AudioSignal
  - MIDI
  - Texture
- Update node menu entries ("Filter/foo") to match new hierarchy
- Update certain nodes to be dynamic in ports:
  - MathExpr, have unlimited inputs
  - MergeNode, multiple layers
    - Also make MergeNode support alpha compositing
- Update NodeWizard to respect these things
  - Also add support for more input/output types (float[] for audio)
- Test whether WasapiMic works on OSX, otherwise consider alternative support?
  - Haha no, it crashes the editor
