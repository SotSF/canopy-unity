### Overview
Unity-based controller and visualizer for the Canopy.

### Developing
1. [Get the Unity editor](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download) for your platform. It's free.
2. Once it's installed, click the 'Open' button and select this repository's folder.
3. Open the "Canopy" scene under the "Assets/Scenes/" directory in the 'Project' tab (analogous to the assets or static files associated with a web app) 
4. To add a new pattern, click the 'UI/PatternTiles' object in the left side 'Hierarchy' tab (analogous to the DOM), and then click the 'Create new pattern' button in the right-side 'Inspector' tab (analogous to... the Inspector in eg Chrome)
5. A new file should be created in the 'Project' tab, at the path 'Assets/PatternSystem/Patterns/' called 'NewPattern'. Double click this to edit it.
6. Visual Studio should open the file, which has the basic structure laid out already along with utility functions.
7. Once you've defined your pattern, click the triangular Play button above the 'Scene' tab (analogous to the browser window), and you should see your pattern in action! You can click the square holding it to put it on the canopy.
