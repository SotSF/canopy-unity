- signals and inputs
  - filter which takes [0,1] and rescales to [x,y]
  - keyboard axis which takes two keys for +/- and gives [-1,1]
  - latch which latches a value as it comes through
  - latching slider which can nudge up/down given axis input
  - spiking inputs
  - beat trainer (press key at freq, latches frequency)
  - signal generation: besides straight oscillator, use anim curves
    - anim curve drawing shader to allow thumbnails etc
  - animation curve driven 
  - events?
- xbox controller:
  - make it do stuff
- load assets off disk at runtime
  - use native file window to pick new stuff
  - use Application.datapath + folders to store / load textures / animatedtextures
- patterns:
  - spark trace
  - keyboard (play keys around outside of circle, tuneable color parameters etc, use to feed fluid)
- fluid sim:
  - allow ink diffusion
- code quality / refactoring
  - base Pattern class, button/wizard (somewhere) to generate new shader+node
    - if wizard, take in name / type (tex filter (tex in+out), tex pattern (tex out), signal filter (float in/out), signal generator (float out), etc)
  - Finish implementing Singleton shit for managers
  - put oscillation into nodes instead of stupid oscillator manager shit (compute buffer overhead is expensive)
